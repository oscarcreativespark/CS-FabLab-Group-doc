> _Briefly describe the goal of the assignment. What are you characterizing, testing, or exploring_

For our group assignment, we evaluated several approaches for creating interfaces to microcontrollers. After comparing multiple options, I (Thom) implemented a _web-based dashboard_ approach using MicroPython and the Microdot framework.&#x20;

> _List all the machines, software and materials used in this assigment._

Thom:

For the web dashboard implementation:

* MicroPython programming language
* Microdot web framework
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend design
* Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller
* Push button (connected to GPIO 21)
* Onboard LED for visual feedback
* Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) for interface access

My implementation uses the Microdot framework to create a lightweight web server ran via Thonny, on the Pico W that:

1. Sets up a WiFi access point named "fab" with password "classroom5"

1. Serves a responsive HTML/CSS/JS interface on port 80

1. Provides API endpoints for controlling the onboard LED (/on and /off)
2. Monitors the state of a physical button connected to GPIO 21
3. Updates the web interface in real-time when button state changes
4. Displays timestamps of button press events

Approach Comparison

**Web Dashboard** (My Implementation)

Pros:\
\- Device-agnostic - works on any device with a browser\
\- Familiar HTML/CSS/JS technologies\
\- No app installation required\
\- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop

Cons:\
\- Requires network connectivity\
\- Higher resource usage on microcontroller\
\- Limited to HTTP protocol without websockets\


**Best Use Cases:** Ideal for local control systems, home automation interfaces, and projects where multiple users need access through different devices

**Command Line Interface**\
Pros:\
\- Minimal resource usage\
\- Simple to implement\
\- Scriptable and automatable\


Cons:\
\- Not user-friendly for non-technical users\
\- Limited visual feedback\
\- Requires terminal access\
**Best Use Cases:** Development and debugging tools, headless systems, or scenarios with very limited resources
